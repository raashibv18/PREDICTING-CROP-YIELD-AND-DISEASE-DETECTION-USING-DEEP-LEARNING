# PREDICTING-CROP-YIELD-AND-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
ABSTRACT

Deep learning revolutionizes agriculture by enhancing crop yield prediction and disease detection through LSTM and CNN models. The LSTM network analyzes historical climate, soil, and yield data to forecast production trends with high accuracy, enabling farmers to optimize resources. Meanwhile, the CNN model detects plant diseases from images, achieving over 90% classification accuracy based on the dataset. These models operate independently, addressing key agricultural challenges while improving precision farming. By reducing errors and enabling early disease intervention, deep learning enhances reliability in farming decisions. The results highlight AI’s potential in mitigating risks, minimizing yield loss, and promoting sustainable agriculture. This research underscores the transformative impact of AI-driven solutions in modern farming.

INTRODUCTION

Agriculture is fraught with uncertainties, but AI-powered precision farming is transforming the field. This project utilizes deep learning—LSTM networks for accurate yield prediction and CNNs for early disease detection—analyzing time-series data and plant images to provide real-time insights. Unlike traditional methods, these models identify patterns that might be overlooked, reducing reliance on guesswork. By forecasting yields and detecting diseases early, farmers can make data-driven decisions, minimizing losses and improving efficiency. This smart approach ensures sustainable farming, higher productivity, and a more secure food supply. With AI-driven automation, resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides are optimized, reducing waste and environmental impact. Ultimately, deep learning revolutionizes agriculture by making it more resilient, adaptive, and future-ready.
